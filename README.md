> Today I Learned

This repo is inspired directly by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). This is a collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. They should all be ~200 words. This is an effort to continue [Learning In Publicâ„¢](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

# TIL

> Today I Learned

This repo is inspired directly by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). This is a collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. They should all be ~200 words. This is an effort to continue [Learning In Publicâ„¢](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

## Usage

The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.

## About

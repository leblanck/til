# Creating an HTML Boilerplate with VSCode Shortcut 

I often find myself needing a quick HTML page for testing etc. Instead of manually typing all of this out, VS Code has a great option for this that I always forget. Maybe I'll remember now...

Open an empty `index.html` and press `!`. This will show a couple of options. Press Enter or click on the first option. This will put a full HTML boilerplate in your current document like the below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

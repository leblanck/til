# How To Add a License to Existing Repo on GitHub

I accidently omitted a license from this repo when I first created it. To add one after the fact:

1. On Github, Create a New File
2. Name it LICENSE or LICENSE.md and a License Template will automatically appear
3. Select a Template, Review the PR, Merge. Done!
